            <img src="nachos.jpg" alt="a pile of yummy nachos"/>
            This image of nachos is one of my favourite comfort foods. It is made with tortilla chips covered in salsa and cheese and vegetables. Sometimes beef or another meat is added to the top. They are grilled in the oven until all the cheese melts. Don't forget to serve with gaucamole.

            <img src="macaroni.jpg"/ alt="macaroni and cheese">
           
            This image of macaroni and cheese is good but ruined by ham or bacon being added. I do not know why someone would ruin delicious meals with bacon. Who are these people? lol But basically made by a bechamel white cheese sauce and cooked pasta. To make it extra yummy add bread crumbs and shredded cheddar on top then grill in the oven to melt the cheddar.

            Fried rice with an egg is delicous with the egg mixed up and scrambled first then added to the fried rice. Or you can do it like the photo shows and top the rice with a fried egg. <br/>
